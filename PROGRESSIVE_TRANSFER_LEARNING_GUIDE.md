# Progressive Transfer Learning Guide

## Overview

This codebase now supports progressive transfer learning across different ImageNet stages, transferring weights from smaller/easier datasets to larger/more complex ones.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Training Function: `train_model_with_transfer()`

**Location:** `training_utils.py`

**Features:**
- Loads pretrained weights from previous stage
- Automatically saves weights for next stage
- Handles different final layer sizes (strict=False)
- Returns both metrics and model weights

### 2. Updated Model Loading: `resnet50_imagenet()`

**Location:** `models.py`

**Changes:**
- Now supports loading torchvision ImageNet pretrained weights
- Automatically handles different output layer sizes
- Can be enabled with `pretrained=True` parameter

### 3. Example Script: `progressive_transfer_learning_example.py`

Complete working example showing how to chain training across all 4 stages.

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the Example Script (Recommended)

```bash
cd ERAv4S9
python progressive_transfer_learning_example.py
```

This will automatically run all 4 stages in sequence:
1. ImageNette â†’ Saves weights for Tiny ImageNet
2. Tiny ImageNet â†’ Saves weights for ImageNet Mini
3. ImageNet Mini â†’ Saves weights for Full ImageNet
4. Full ImageNet â†’ Final model

### Option 2: Manual Progressive Training in Notebook

```python
from training_utils import train_model_with_transfer

# Stage 1: Start with ImageNette
DATASET_NAME = "imagenette"
Config.update_for_dataset(DATASET_NAME)
train_loader, test_loader = get_data_loaders(DATASET_NAME)
model = get_model(model_name="resnet50", dataset_name=DATASET_NAME)

metrics1, weights1 = train_model_with_transfer(
    model, train_loader, test_loader, device, Config,
    pretrained_weights_path=None,  # Start fresh
    next_stage_name="tiny_imagenet"  # Save for next
)

# Stage 2: Use ImageNette weights for Tiny ImageNet
DATASET_NAME = "tiny_imagenet"
Config.update_for_dataset(DATASET_NAME)
train_loader, test_loader = get_data_loaders(DATASET_NAME)
model = get_model(model_name="resnet50", dataset_name=DATASET_NAME)

metrics2, weights2 = train_model_with_transfer(
    model, train_loader, test_loader, device, Config,
    pretrained_weights_path="./models/weights_for_tiny_imagenet.pth",
    next_stage_name="imagenet_mini"
)

# Continue for remaining stages...
```

### Option 3: With Torchvision Pretrained Weights

```python
# Start first stage with ImageNet pretrained weights
model = get_model(model_name="resnet50", dataset_name="imagenette", pretrained=True)

# Then continue with progressive transfer learning
metrics, weights = train_model_with_transfer(
    model, train_loader, test_loader, device, Config,
    pretrained_weights_path=None,
    next_stage_name="tiny_imagenet"
)
```

## File Structure After Training

After running progressive transfer learning, you'll have:

```
./models/
â”œâ”€â”€ weights_for_tiny_imagenet.pth       # From ImageNette â†’ Tiny ImageNet
â”œâ”€â”€ weights_for_imagenet_mini.pth      # From Tiny ImageNet â†’ ImageNet Mini
â”œâ”€â”€ weights_for_imagenet.pth           # From ImageNet Mini â†’ Full ImageNet
â”œâ”€â”€ best_model_imagenette.pth          # Best ImageNette model
â”œâ”€â”€ best_model_tiny_imagenet.pth       # Best Tiny ImageNet model
â”œâ”€â”€ best_model_imagenet_mini.pth       # Best ImageNet Mini model
â””â”€â”€ best_model_imagenet.pth            # Final best model
```

## Benefits of Progressive Transfer Learning

### 1. Faster Convergence
- Each stage starts from a better initialization
- Fewer epochs needed per stage

### 2. Better Final Accuracy
- Gradual adaptation to increasing complexity
- More stable training

### 3. Efficient Training
- Learn on easier data first (10 classes â†’ 200 â†’ 1000)
- Build features progressively

### 4. Lower Overfitting
- Intermediate stages provide regularization
- Better generalization to test set

## Expected Improvements

| Stage | Dataset | Classes | Expected Accuracy Improvement |
|-------|---------|---------|------------------------------|
| 1 (fresh) | ImageNette | 10 | Baseline: ~45% |
| 1 (with transfer) | ImageNette | 10 | With ImageNet weights: **~65%+** |
| 2 (fresh) | Tiny ImageNet | 200 | Baseline: ~30% |
| 2 (with transfer) | Tiny ImageNet | 200 | With ImageNette weights: **~45%+** |
| 3 (fresh) | ImageNet Mini | 1000 | Baseline: ~15% |
| 3 (with transfer) | ImageNet Mini | 1000 | With Tiny ImageNet weights: **~25%+** |
| 4 (fresh) | Full ImageNet | 1000 | Baseline: ~10% |
| 4 (with transfer) | Full ImageNet | 1000 | With ImageNet Mini weights: **~20%+** |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with pretrained weights**: Use `pretrained=True` for first stage
2. **Use appropriate learning rates**:
   - With transfer: Start with lower LR (1e-4 to 1e-5)
   - Fresh training: Normal LR (1e-3 to 1e-2)
3. **Gradually increase complexity**: 10 â†’ 200 â†’ 1000 classes
4. **Monitor transfer success**: Check if validation accuracy improves faster
5. **Experiment with freezing**: Optionally freeze early layers, only train FC

## Troubleshooting

### Weights don't load?
- Check if `pretrained_weights_path` exists
- Check if shapes match (strict=False should help)
- Error messages will indicate the issue

### Poor performance after transfer?
- Try lower learning rate (1e-5)
- Reduce epochs (model already has good features)
- Check if augmentation is too aggressive

### Out of memory?
- Reduce batch size
- Use gradient accumulation
- Train one stage at a time

## Next Steps

1. Run the example script to see how it works
2. Adjust learning rates per stage as needed
3. Experiment with different stage combinations
4. Compare results with/without transfer learning

Happy training! ðŸš€
